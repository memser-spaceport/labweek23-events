  "description": "Location:  Neuchatel (7th floor) - Swissôtel - A day long track to discuss libp2p developments from the ecosystem, libp2p + privacy, new work on the DHT from ProbeLab, and more!\nlibp2p Day 2023 is a watering hole for the libp2p community. This is not a Protocol Labs dominated event (in fact, many of the PL maintainers will be unable to attend). The organizers hope the libp2p community feels empowered to share anything ranging from recent wins, updates, current challenges, deep dives, demos, etc. This can range from a quick lightning talk, show-and-tell demo, to a more thorough deep dive. Anything is welcome - there is no prescribed formula here!\n\nFor more information on the day's schedule and other info, please see: https://github.com/libp2p/specs/discussions/591",

Decentralized pubsub protocols are optimized for low-latency real-time delivery, but don't have a robust way for peers to catch up on missing messages after long periods of downtime or network partitions. We can use a new type of merkleized database index called Prolly trees to let peers efficiently sync large sets of messages in persistent storage. We can even extend this approach to add causal ordering using logical clocks. Joel is an ex-PL researcher and co-founder of Canvas, a framework for building automatically decentralized applications."

If you're unfamiliar with libp2p, it can be intimidating. The universal-connectivity example showcases how neatly libp2p abstracts ubiquitous peer-to-peer connectivity between multiple programming languages (Go, Rust, TypeScript) and runtimes (Web, native binary) using QUIC, WebRTC and WebTransport.\n\nBut it's still missing some key parts like ambient peer discovery for it to be a forkable example that can also serve as an educational resource. This takes away from the potential magic it could offer.\n\nIn this brief talk, he'll explore:\n\nWhy universal-connectivity is so important for the libp2p project\nHow we can use it to onboard more developers to using libp2p\nChallenges with peer discovery and some of the explored solutions\nAdditional use-cases the app could explore\n\n"
