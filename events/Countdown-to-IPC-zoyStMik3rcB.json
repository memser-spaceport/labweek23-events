  "description": "InterPlanetary Consensus (IPC) is a transformative blockchain architecture that enables planetary-scale performance by introducing the innovative concept of blockchains within blockchains. This pioneering approach creates infinitely scalable networks, forming dynamic tree networks of recursive blockchains, or \"subnets.\" IPC's mission is to bridge the performance and usability gap between Web2 and Web3, powering a decentralized planetary-scale economy with unmatched speed and functionality comparable to centralized systems.

        "description": "Juan Benet, CEO of Protocol Labs, will discuss the scalability challenges faced by current decentralized systems, including blockchains, and explain why a significant increase in transaction capacity is necessary to realize the vision of Web3. The objective of Web3 is to replace centrally controlled applications with decentralized alternatives that are more user-friendly, resilient, open, and empower users to own their data and govern themselves, while providing transparency in data processing and decision-making. However, achieving this goal is currently unfeasible due to the insufficient scalability of blockchains, which lack the capacity to store data and compute power required for applications comparable to Twitter, Facebook, Figma, Gmail, and TikTok. Juan will illustrate why scalability is a crucial bottleneck for Web3 and highlight its potential to facilitate a transformative range of applications in the future."

We'll cover the basic tech that IPC is built on, look at current market trends, and discuss the existing tech limits. Together, we'll imagine the new kinds of applications that could become possible with advancements in IPC and talk about the essential research required to make this vision a reality. It’s all about understanding IPC better and getting ready for the amazing opportunities that lie ahead!"
